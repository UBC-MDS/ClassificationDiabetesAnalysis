    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This study evaluated logistic regression for predicting diabetes in Pima Indian women using features such as glucose levels, BMI, and pregnancies. The model achieved 75% accuracy on the test set, outperforming the baseline dummy classifier's 67.20%. Glucose was the most significant predictor, followed by BMI and pregnancies, while blood pressure and insulin had weaker impacts. The model misclassified 54 cases, with 35 false negatives and 19 false positives, highlighting areas for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results indicate that logistic regression is a promising tool for diabetes screening, providing an efficient way to identify potential cases. However, the high number of false negatives is concerning, as they could lead to delayed diagnoses and treatments. Future improvements could include feature engineering to address misclassifications, testing alternative machine learning models, and incorporating additional data, such as lifestyle or genetic factors. Adding probability estimates for predictions could also enhance its clinical usability by helping prioritize further diagnostic tests. These steps could make the model more reliable and practical for real-world healthcare applications."

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Diabetes is a serious chronic disease characterized by high levels of glucose in the blood, caused by either insufficient insulin production by the pancreas or the body’s inability to effectively use insulin. It has become a significant global health issue, with its prevalence nearly doubling since 1980, and in 2022, 14% of adults aged 18 and older were diagnosed with diabetes, doubling from 7% in 1990 (World Health Organization). Diabetes can lead to severe complications, including blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, strokes, and lower limb amputations. Early detection enables timely interventions, reduces complications, lowers healthcare costs, and improves quality of life and long-term outcomes (Marshall & Flyvbjerg, 2006).\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial intelligence (AI) leverages computer systems and big data to simulate intelligent behavior with minimal human intervention, and within it, machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI methodologies. Since the rise of AI, Machine learning has increasingly been applied in various areas of disease detection and prevention in the healthcare field (Bini, 2018). Numerous machine learning techniques have been deployed to develop more efficient and effective methods for diagnosing chronic diseases (Battineni, Chinatalapudi, & Amenta, 2020). Utilizing machine learning methods in diabetes research has been proven to be a critical strategy for harnessing large volumes of diabetes-related data to extract valuable insights (Agarwal & Vadiwala, 2022). Therefore, The goal of this report is to leverage a supervised machine learning model, logistic regression (LR), to evaluate its predictive performance in diagnosing diabetes using a real-world dataset focused specifically on Pima Indian women aged 21 and older."

    "The dataset that was used for the analysis of this project was created by Jack W Smith, JE Everhart, WC Dickson, WC Knowler, RS Johannes and sourced from the National Librabry of Medicine database from the National Institues of Health. Access to their respective analysis can be found [here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2245318/) and access to the dataset can be found via [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database/data) (Dua & Graff, 2017). The primary objective of the dataset is to enable diagnostic prediction of whether a patient has diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements. To ensure consistency and relevance, several constraints were applied to the selection of data instances. Specifically, the dataset includes only female patients who are at least 21 years old and of Pima Indian heritage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row/obersvation from the dataset is an individual that identifies to be a part of the Pima (also known as The Akimel O'odham) Indeginous group, located mainly in the Central and Southern regions of the United States. Each observation recorded has summary statistics regarding features that include the Age, BMI, Blood Pressure, Number of Pregnancies, as well as The Diabetes Pedigree Function (which is a score that gives an idea about how much correlation is between person with diabetes and their family history). The dataset offers comprehensive feastures for machine learning analysis."

    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression was employed to develop a classification model for predicting whether the patient is diabetic or not (as indicated in the `outcome` column of the dataset). All variables from the original dataset were used to train the model. The data was split into 70% for the training set and 30% for the testing set. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using `RandomizedSearchCV`, with the accuracy score serving as the classification metric. All variables were standardized just before model fitting. The analysis was conducted using the Python programming language (Van Rossum and Drake, 2009) and several Python packages: numpy (Harris et al., 2020), Pandas (McKinney, 2010), altair (VanderPlas, 2018), altair_ally (Ostblom, 2021) and scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011). The code used for this analysis and report is available at: https://github.com/UBC-MDS/diabetes_predictor_py"

    "- For `Pregnancies` we have chosen the range of 0-15; although having 15 pregnancies is very unlikely there has been rare historic cases for this upper limit. Anything beyond 15 is too high of an outlier to keep within the dataset.\n",
    "- For `Glucose`, we chose the range of 50-240 as any glucose level below 50 and above 240 would require immediate medical attention, therefore these values are outliers that are not sustainable and in turn not fit for our model.\n",
    "- For `BloodPressure` the acceptable range of 40-180 was chosen as any blood pressure level below 40 will cause dizziness, fainting, shock-like symptoms, cold/clammy skin, or rapid breathing. Meanwhile anything above 180 is a dangerourly high level and a Hypertensive Crisis. In both cases immediate medical attention is required therefore these values are not suitable for our classification model.\n",
    "- For `SkinThickness` (in terms of the Triceps' skin fold) the thickness of skin cannot be below 0 mm and any level of thickness above 80 mm is a very extreme and unlikely level of obesity. Meaning any value below 0 mm would be an error and any value above 80 mm is a very high outlier\n",
    "- For `Insulin` the acceptable range is 0-800. Although having a insulin level of 0 is unlikely there are instances where the insulin level is so low that it is not detected during a test giving the value of 0. Regarding the upper limit of 700 anything above this range considered severe hyperglycemia and needs immediate emergency treatment, thus not suitable when looking at ranges that do not include outliers\n",
    "- For `BMI` the range of 0-65 was chosen as your BMI cannot be lower than 0 and going over 65 is an extreme case of obesity.\n",
    "- For `DiabetesPedigreeFunction` repersents the genetic risk of diabetes based on family history. Therefore this value cannot be smaller than 0 (which repersents having no familial diabetic history), meanwhile the upper limit of 2.5 repersents having both parents and other close family members having diabetic history, which is an unlikely value to encounter.\n",
    "- For `Age` we have chosen the range 18-90 as this test was conducted on adults, we have chosen the upper limit of 90 as it is unlikely for someone to be above 90. "

    "Figure 2 shows the correlation between all of the respective features. The main reasoning to analyze this is to see if there is any multicollinearity between any of the features which cou;d be problamatic when conducting a Logistic Regression. We see that highest level of correlation is between Age and Pregnancies (0.62 via Spearman, and 0.56 by Pearson). Since this is below the threshold of 0.7, we can conclude that all features' coefficients are suitable and will not cause any multicollinearity in our model. "

    "# Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "While the performance of this model may be valuable as a screening tool in a clinical context, especially given its improvements over the baseline, there are several opportunities for further enhancement. One potential approach is to closely examine the 54 misclassified observations, comparing them with correctly classified examples from both classes. The objective would be to identify which features may be contributing to the misclassifications and investigate whether feature engineering could help the model improve its predictions on the observations it is currently struggling with. Additionally, we would try seeing whether we can get improved predictions using other classifiers. Other classifiers we might try are 1) random forest because it automatically allows for feature interaction, 2) k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) which usually provides easily interpretable and decent predictions, and 3) support vector classifier (SVC) as it allows for non-linear prediction using the rbf kernel. Finally, there runs the possibility that the features offered from this dataset alone are not sufficient to predict with high accuracy. In this case, conducting additional conversations with data collectors for additional useable information or explore additional datasets that can be joined so our set of features can be expanded for more complicated analysis might be beneficial. \n",
    "\n",
    "At last, we recognize the limitation with this dataset, as it focuses solely on Pima Indian women aged 21 and older, which limits its generalizability to other populations. To improve the analysis, it would be valuable to combine this data with other datasets representing different age groups, genders, and ethnicities, enabling more comprehensive insights and broader applicability of the findings."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this study demonstrated the effectiveness of logistic regression in predicting diabetes among Pima Indian women using diagnostic features such as glucose, BMI, and pregnancies. With an accuracy of 75% on the test set, the model outperformed the baseline Dummy Classifier's 67.20%. Glucose was identified as the most influential predictor, followed by BMI and pregnancies, while features like blood pressure, insulin, and skin thickness had weaker impacts. However, the model's 54 misclassifications, particularly the 35 false negatives, underscore the need for further refinement to minimize the risk of undiagnosed cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings highlight logistic regression's potential as an initial screening tool in clinical settings, offering a data-driven approach to early diabetes detection. Nevertheless, improvements are essential to enhance its accuracy and practical utility. Strategies such as feature engineering, alternative machine learning models, and the incorporation of additional data, such as lifestyle or genetic factors, could further optimize performance. Additionally, providing probability estimates for predictions could enhance clinical decision-making by identifying cases requiring further diagnostics. With these refinements, the model could become a valuable tool for reducing complications and improving outcomes in diabetes care."
